Welcome to my home page! My name is Catherine Chen; I am an Assistant Professor in Political Communication at both [the Manship School of Mass Communication](https://www.lsu.edu/manship/index.php) and [the Department of Political Science](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/polisci/) at Louisiana State University. I am also honored to be appointed to the prestigious Mary P. Poindexter Endowed Professorship. I received my Ph.D. in [Communication at Stanford University](https://comm.stanford.edu/) in 2024.

My research interests revolve around **understanding the antecedents, structure, and consequences of political attitudes among Americans**. Specifically, my work focuses on examining **people's attitudes toward science and technologies**. My methodological toolkit encompasses a range of techniques, including surveys, lab and field experiments, quasi-experiments, and automated text analysis with Large Language Models.

Within this framework, I have been pursuing three interconnected research questions. 
* What are the origins, underlying structure, and implications of **Americans' attitudes toward Science, Health, Environment, and Risk (SHER)**? 
* What are the factors that contribute to the **partisan divide in attitudes toward SHER** in the United States, and how to bridge this gap? 
* How do human and machine/AI interactions influence the perception and communication of scientific knowledge?

My research findings have been disseminated through prestigious peer-reviewed journals such as *Climate Change* and *Health Psychology*. My research has received support from various institutions, including [the Stanford Center for Democracy (SCAD)](https://iriss.stanford.edu/research-centers/american-democracy), [the Stanford Institute for Research in the Social Sciences (IRiSS)](https://iriss.stanford.edu/), and [the Rapoport Family Foundation](https://www.rapoportfamilyfoundation.com/). I have been honored to hold positions such as the Melville J. Jacoby Fellow and the SAP Fellow under [the Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf). I was a Doctoral Dissertation Fellow at IRiSS.

Outside academia, I have worked as a journalism intern at the Agence France-Presse (AFP) and a public relations intern at Sina Corps. I was born and raised in Dalian, China and spent some time in both Hong Kong and Australia. I am a cat lover and also find joy in exploring nature!
